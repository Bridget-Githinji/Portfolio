        <h2><strong>About me</strong></h2>
        <p>My name is <span>Bridget Njoki Githinji</span>; I love coding and i wish to make a career, a flourishing career that solves the problems we are facing as country, out of it.<br>
            Before February of this year, I knew very little of coding and programming. All i knew is that i wanted to be a doctor to come up with all types of cancer treatments to treat 
            my patients with hence make them happy. I had just heard of codes and programs and i thought that these were terms that people flung around just to seem
            cool. I was obviously oblivious to the coding world.<br><br>This was until an old man gave me an opportunity to code; gave me all the materials needed and left me to it. He had faith in me.
            He had faith in me and he somehow knew i could do it. In my head i was thinking, this is not my cup of tea, but i'm going to try it anyway. By the end of week one, i found myself craving for more
            knowledge in code; i have not looked back since then.</p>

        <h3>Why take a class on programming?</h3>
        <p>My mind is set and my objectives are now clear on what I want to do and achieve in life; I want to be an expert coder who is going to provide solutions to the problems we are facing as a country. 
           With that in mind, I believe that taking programming classes is the first step towards that goal. Being able to learn programming and do it with those that have the same yearning will enable me to 
           harness my full potential in this field as well as gather as much resources as i can for my future goals.</p>
